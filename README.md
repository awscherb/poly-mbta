> This language is cool. I want to write some code in it, but I don't know what to write!

<p>Oftentimes, I think some language is cool, and want to write code in it, but don't know what to write. Usually, I don't have a specific need for a lanugage, and I desire to create something more than a simple 'hello world' program. poly-mbta is my solution to that. Given my knowledge of and affinity for the MBTA, my solution was to create a program that will give arrival predictions for the MBTA
<p>The program will accept a single input. ```place-masta``` for example, corresponds with [Mass Ave.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Avenue_%28MBTA_Orange_Line_station%29) station. The program will output arrival predictions for all modes of transit in all directions from the station at the current time.
